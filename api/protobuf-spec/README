The protofile specifies the RPC calls. In order to generate the code from it
the following command is to be issued.

protoc -I stork/ stork/api/protobuf-spec/agent.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:stork

The generated agent.pb.go has been also checked in to the repository.

In order to test the RPC call run cmd/stag/stag (as a server) and then
run cmd/stork/stork (as a client). The client should receive the hardcoded
stork "version" string.

The latest versions of wireshark can decode grpc and HTTP2 binary format.

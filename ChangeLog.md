LEGEND
* [bug]   General bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
          unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
	      compatibility to fix the bug.
* [build] Compilation and installation infrastructure change.
* [doc]   Update to documentation. This shouldn't change run time behavior.
* [func]  new feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
	      change, which would require a bump of major version.
* [sec]   Security hole fix. This is no different than a general bug
          fix except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause
 	      security patch releases.

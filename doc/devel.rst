Developer's Guide

.. note::

   We acknowledge that users and developers are two different groups of people, so the documents
   should eventually be separated. However, since these are still very early days of the project,
   this section is kept in the Stork ARM for convenience only.

Generating Documentation
========================

To generate documentation, simply type ``rake doc``. You need to have `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_
and `rtd-theme <https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme>`_ installed. The generated
documentation will be available in the ``doc/singlehtml`` directory.

Agent API
=========

The connection between the server and the agents is established using gRPC over http/2. The agent API
definition is kept in the ``backend/api/agent.proto`` file. For debugging purposes, it is possible
to connect to the agent using `grpcurl <https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl>`_ tool. For example,
you can retrieve a list of currently provided gRPC calls by using this command:

.. code:: console

    $ grpcurl -plaintext -proto backend/api/agent.proto localhost:8888 describe
    agentapi.Agent is a service:
    service Agent {
      rpc detectServices ( .agentapi.DetectServicesReq ) returns ( .agentapi.DetectServicesRsp );
      rpc getState ( .agentapi.GetStateReq ) returns ( .agentapi.GetStateRsp );
      rpc restartKea ( .agentapi.RestartKeaReq ) returns ( .agentapi.RestartKeaRsp );
    }

You can also make specific gRPC calls. For example, to get the machine state, the following command
can be used:

.. code:: console

    $ grpcurl -plaintext -proto backend/api/agent.proto localhost:8888 agentapi.Agent.getState
    {
      "agentVersion": "0.1.0",
      "hostname": "copernicus",
      "cpus": "8",
      "cpusLoad": "1.68 1.46 1.28",
      "memory": "16",
      "usedMemory": "59",
      "uptime": "2",
      "os": "darwin",
      "platform": "darwin",
      "platformFamily": "Standalone Workstation",
      "platformVersion": "10.14.6",
      "kernelVersion": "18.7.0",
      "kernelArch": "x86_64",
      "hostID": "c41337a1-0ec3-3896-a954-a1f85e849d53"
    }

Installing git hooks
====================

There's a simple git hook that inserts the issue number in the commit message automatically. If you
want to use it, go to ``utils`` directory and run ``git-hooks-install`` script. It will copy the
necessary file to ``.git/hooks`` directory.


ReST API
========

The primary user of ReST API is Stork UI in web browser. The definition of ReST API is located
in api folder and is described in Swagger 2.0 format.

The description in Swagger is split into multiple files. 2 files comprise a tag group:

* \*-paths.yaml - defines URLs
* \*-defs.yaml - contains entity definitions

All these files are combined by ``yamlinc`` tool into signle swagger file ``swagger.yaml``.
Then from ``swagger.yaml`` there are generated code for:

* UI fronted by swagger-codegen
* backend in Go lang by go-swagger

All these steps are realized in Rakefile.

Docker Containers
=================

To ease testing, there are several docker containers available. Not all of them are necessary.

* ``server`` - This container is essential. It runs the Stork server, which interacts with all the
  agents, the database and exposes API. Without it, Stork will not be able to function.
* ``postgres`` - This container is essential. It runs the PostgreSQL database that is used by the
  Stork server. Without it, Stork server will will only able to produce error messages about
  unavailable database.
* ``webui`` - This container is essential in most circumstances. It provides the front web
  interface. You could possibly not run it, if you are developing your own Stork API client.

There are also several containers provided that are used to samples. Those will not be needed in a
production network, however they're very useful to demonstrate existing Stork capabilities. They
simulate certain services that Stork is able to handle:

* ``agent-bind9`` - This container runs BIND 9 server. If you run it, you can add it as a machine
  and Stork will begin monitoring its BIND 9 service.

* ``agent-kea`` - This container runs Kea DHCPv4 server. If you run it, you can add it as a machine
  and Stork will begin monitoring its BIND 9 service.

* ``agent-kea-ha1`` and ``agent-kea-ha2`` - Those two containers should in general be run
  together. They have each a Kea DHCPv4 server instance configured in a HA pair. If you run both of
  them and register them as machines in Stork, you will be able to observe certain HA mechanisms,
  such as one taking over the traffic if the partner becomes unavailable.

* ``traffic-dhcp`` - This container is optional. If stated, it will start transmitting DHCP packets
  towards agent-kea. It may be useful to observe non-zero statistics coming from Kea. If you're
  running Stork in docker, you can coveniently control that using ``rake start_traffic_dhcp`` and
  ``rake stop_traffic_dhcp`` commands.
